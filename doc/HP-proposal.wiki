= split package proposal =

This is a proposal for the [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/split split package] to be included in the next major release of the Haskell platform.

Everyone is invited to review this proposal, following the [http://trac.haskell.org/haskell-platform/wiki/AddingPackages standard procedure for proposing and reviewing packages].

Review comments should be sent to the libraries mailing list by August 20 (arbitrarily chosen; there's plenty of time before the [http://trac.haskell.org/haskell-platform/wiki/ReleaseTimetable October 1 deadline].

= Abstract =

The Data.List.Split module contains a wide range of strategies for splitting lists with respect to some sort of delimiter, mostly implemented through a unified combinator interface. The goal is to be a flexible yet simple alternative to the standard 'split' function found in some other mainstream languages.

= Rationale =

Splitting a list into chunks based on some sort of delimiter(s) is a
common need, and
