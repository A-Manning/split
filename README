delimiter.

  There are no dependencies other than the base package.
  Data.List.Split has been tested with versions of GHC from 6.8.3 up
  through 7.6.1.

  The Properties.hs file depends on QuickCheck >= 2.4, but you don't
  need it in order to build the library.

Build with Cabal:

Building Haddock documentation (recommended):

    cabal haddock

  Once the documentation has been built, you can access it by 
  pointing your browser to dist/doc/html/split/index.html.
